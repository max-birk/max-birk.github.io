<h3>Game-based Digital Biomarker for Acute and Chronic Stress</h3>
<p>#health #well-being #cognition #game-design #game-development</p>


<p>Digital data provide valuable information to detect changes in indicators of health such as cognitive performance, emotions, or behaviour. However, currently researchers lack protocols and methods to design and validate digital indicators of health. In my the project "Game-based Digital Biomarker for Acute and Chronic Stress", we will establish methods and protocols for digital indicators of stress using videogames.</p>

<h3>Behavioural Design in Video Games</h3>
<p>#video-games #health #behavioural-design #engagement</p>

<p>
  Game design has an impact on health and wellbeing. Young people and children are especially sensitive to the negative and positive impact of media design choices, due to their evolving capacities. To protect young people ethical and responsible game design practices are necessary. But what constitutes ‘ethical’ and responsible game design? Outside of the video game industry itself, game design choices are poorly understood and hard to discuss due to a lack of terminology and the lack of a coherent framework.

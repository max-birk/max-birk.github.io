Digital data provide valuable information to detect changes in indicators of health such as cognitive performance, emotions, or behaviour. However, currently researchers lack protocols and methods to design and validate digital indicators of health. In my the project "Game-based Digital Biomarker for Acute and Chronic Stress", we will establish methods and protocols for digital indicators of stress using videogames.
